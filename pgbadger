PostgreSQL Configuration:

 log_line_prefix = '%t [%p]: user=%u,db=%d,app=%a,client=%h '
 log_min_duration_statement = 0
   log_checkpoints = on
    log_connections = on
    log_disconnections = on
    log_lock_waits = on
    log_temp_files = 0
    log_autovacuum_min_duration = 0
    log_error_verbosity = default

For query statistics to include the actual query strings -> log_min_duration_statement either 0 or some milliseconds
To report duration and no. of queries,don't want details about queries -> log_min_duration_statement=-1 to disable it,enable log_duration

"Enabling log_min_duration_statement will add reports about slowest queries and queries that took up the most time"
Note : If you have log_statement set to 'all', nothing will be logged with log_min_duration_statement.

Warning: Do not enable both log_min_duration_statement, log_duration and log_statement all together, 
this will result in wrong counter values. Note that this will also increase drastically the size of your log. 
log_min_duration_statement should always be preferred.
